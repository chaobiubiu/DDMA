# DDMA: Discrepancy-Driven Multi-Agent reinforcement learning
Anonymous code release for PRICAI 2022 paper submission, named "DDMA: Discrepancy-Driven Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning". This repository develops DDMA algorithm on the bechmarks of Collision Corridor and several MPE scenarios: Cooperative Navigation, Predator and Prey and Individual Defense. We compare DDMA with VDN, QMIX and MAPG in Collision Corridor. And we choose MADDPG, MAAC, G2ANet and noisy-MADDPG as the baselines in these MPE scenarios. Here we provide the detailed descriptions of these environments and all algorithms in the experiments.
